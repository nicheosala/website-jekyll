# Jekyll

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is the static site generator I use for https://nicheosala.tk.\
You may want to build the website locally. In orther to do so:
1. install Jekyll
2. clone this repository
3. open a terminal inside the repository you've just cloned
4. build the website: `bundle exec jekyll build`
5. if you want to serve the site locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
